# Dash_Finance_Card

<p>I had fun working with Dash to create and style this finance card. It tested my dash bootstrap skills for real!</p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks to Alpha Vantage for the API to call for the MSFT values. It was very easy to use and I may rely on them in the future.</p>
I used the .get_intraday method to access stock data for MSFT, which I was then able to clean it up, reverse it, and plot the highs in a line graph, display the delta change, and recommend whether to buy or sell using bootstrap coloring codes.

<p>I really like working with Dash. It took me a minute to understand, but being able to access the callbacks, as well as the dbc, I can see it being worthwhile in the future.</p>
